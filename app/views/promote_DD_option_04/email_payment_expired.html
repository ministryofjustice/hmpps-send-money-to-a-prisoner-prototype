      Dear sender,

    <p>
      We’re sorry to tell you that the <strong>payment session expired</strong> before your payment could be taken.
    </p>

    <p>This payment has NOT gone through to the prisoner’s account.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text mtp-table" style="margin-left:15px">
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>Payment to:</th>
              <td>Prisoner Name (A1234BC)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Payment amount:</th>
              <td>£XX</td>

        </table>
        <span style="color:red;">(would anything else go in here ^^^ ?)</span>
      </div>

    <p><strong>What now?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Your debit card payment has NOT been taken from your account.
      Please go to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">Send money to someone in prison</a> and try again.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

1. If you paid by bank transfer, you may have made a mistake with the prisoner reference number. If you did, you will get an automatic refund about 4 days later into your bank account (reference: ‘MTP NOMS’). Check the refund is there, then use the service again, checking the details as you type.
</br></br>
2. The prisoner will not get your money if you paid by bank transfer from abroad, by CHAPS or in a UK bank branch.
</br></br>
To get a refund, write to the finance department at the prison, including:
</br>
• the prisoner's name, prisoner number and date of birth</br>
• your name and address</br>
• the payment date and the amount</br></br>
The prison will refund you by cheque.</p>"
